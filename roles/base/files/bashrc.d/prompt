# Run oh-my-posh with a custom theme
# Things I like in my prompt:
#   - Full path to current location
#   - Info on source control: branch name and if there's changes
#   - Username
#   - Hostname (hopefully different style if remotely accessed)
#   - If it displays time, 12 hr clock
#   - Input line is on newline

# Here's a bash function to view different prompts
